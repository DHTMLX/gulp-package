# gulp-package

Gulp script to build package from DHTMLX Suite sources

### How to use

- copy files to suite/sources folder
- run 

```
npm install 
gulp
```

Script rebuilds files in codebase folder from sources. 

By default script includes all components.
To change this behavior update "components" structure in gulpfile.js or just delete the unnecessary source files.
